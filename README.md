# Overview

This application was developed as a homework assignment that I had in a *Full Stack Developer* class.

The primary purpose of the assignment was to demonstrate - 

* React - Create components containing various HTML elements including forms, buttons, and styling. 
* Express Server - Configured with file paths and API paths.
* MongoDB / Mongoose - API endpoints save and delete documents in the *saved article* collection.
* Socket.io - The client side of the application connects to a socket and received data updates after POST or DELETE
